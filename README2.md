# Fashion MNIST classification using Inception Networks

The following repository contains the implementation of Inception Netoworks (GoogleNet). Incpetion Networks were first introduced by Google in the 2014 paper titled “Going Deeper with Convolutions”. 
At the core of inception networks are inception block. Inception blocks allow multiple convolutional filter to operate in parallel, hoping to caputure various levels of details from the input.
