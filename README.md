# Fashion_MNIST Classification Model

This project focuses on classifying the Fashion MNIST dataset, which consists of 60,000 training examples and 10,000 test examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image representing one of the following 10 classes:
  1. T-shirt/Top
  2. Trouser
  3. Pullover
  4. Dress
  5. Coat
  6. Sandal
  7. Shirt
  8. Sneaker
  9. Bag
   10. Ankle Boot


# Model Architecture 

The model is inspired by the architecture proposed in the AlexNet paper, and it has been adapted to work with grayscale images of size 28x28. The architecture consists of:
	 • 5 Convolutional Layers:
	    •	Each convolutional layer applies batch normalization to improve training stability and performance.
	    •	The kernel sizes varies from 3 to 11. 
      • The first layer has no padding, while the other layers have padding of either 1 or 2.
	•	3 Fully Connected Layers:
	    •	The fully connected layers process the feature maps generated by the convolutional layers and map them to the final output classes.
	    •	Dropout regularization is applied to the first two fully connected layers to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.


# Performance 
With this architecture, I achieved an accuracy of approximately 90% on the test set. 


# Additional Details
  • Optimization: The model was trained on the Adam Optimizer with a learning rate of 0.002.  
  • Loss Function: Cross Entropy Loss was used as the objective function.   
  • Training: The model was trained for 30 epochs with a batch size of 64.    
  • Pooling: One layer of Max Pooling with a stride of 1 has been applied to reduce the spatial dimensions.    
  • Regularization: Dropout Regularization with a probability of 0.2 was applied to the fully connected layers to prevent overfitting.
